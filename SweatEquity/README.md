A procedural note about modifying this
and subtending pages:
- Pull Requests to modify a participant's page should only be made by the participant
or with their express permission.
- The list on this page is in order that
the organizer received notice a participant
was bringing something to interwork. From now on it will be based on order Pull Requests are received by new participants.
