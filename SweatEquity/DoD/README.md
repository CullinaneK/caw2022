# DoD Sweat Equity

DoD is a cochair and has members of the OpenC2 Technical Committee,
has individual participants in the Security Posture Attribute
Collection and Evaluation
([PACE](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE/tree/main/docs/Arch))
OASIS Open Project,
and sponsors HII to participate in both OpenC2 and PACE.

## 1. Software/Application/Device Contributions
DoD's contributions to the CAW include development of:
* OpenC2 actuator profiles (both PACE- and non-PACE-related)
* OpenC2 message validation tools
* Non-OpenC2 interface specifications (PACE PAR)
* Posture attribute repository (PAR) proof of concept

### 1.1 OpenC2 Actuator Profiles

### 1.2 OpenC2 message validation tools

### 1.3 Non-OpenC2 interface specifications (PACE PAR)

### 1.4 Posture Attribute Repository proof of concept
DoD will develop and make available to CAW participants a PAR proof of concept
implemented on Amazon Web Services using a [GraphQL interface](https://aws.amazon.com/appsync/).
CAW participants will be able to query a set of dummy components (IT assets) and a set of random
but syntactically valid example SBOMs associated with those components.
PAR content will be managed exclusively by the Posture Attribute Collection and
Posture Attribute Retrieval systems; all user access is query-only.
