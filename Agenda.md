# Agenda

**Under Construction**

```

The Workshop will take place 9AM-5PM EDT 2-June-2022.

The four keynote speakers will be:
- Dan Solero (AT&T)
- Allan Friedman (CISA)
- Chuck Brooks (Georgetown University)
- Neal Ziring (NSA)

Feedback from the last workshop recommended
fewer keynotes and spreading the
keynotes throughout the day instead of all at kickoff.
Keynotes were reduced to 4 and they will be:
- kickoff
- just before lunch
- just after lunch
- closing

These times were chosen to keep the meeting on track
(eg you miss hearing keynote if you aren't back from lunch).

The remaining time will be spent either:
- demonstrating interworking parts/all of a use case
   + the hope is much of the details will be worked out prior to the Workshop as to what systems will interoperate on which use case(s)
- trouble shooting interworking
- hackathon to create new lycans or modify interfaces in the spirit of addine new interworking scenarios.

At the last Workshop, participants created <3 min videos introducing themselves
and what they were bringing to the Workshop.
The intent is to do similar for this workshop with some changes:
- videos are to be made prior to 26-May
- videos will be compiled into a YouTube playlist
- playlist will be made available to participants 27-May
- videos will NOT be shown at Workshop. Participants should watch all the videos prior to the start of the Workshop.

Single or multiple track is not yet decided and will depend on
the number and extent of the interworking scenarios.

Prior to 2-June:
- use cases established
- interworking scenarios defined including use cases, systems, interfaces, and participants
- participant videos created and viewed
