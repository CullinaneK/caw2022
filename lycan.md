# Lycans

Interworking involves interfaces from one system
interworking with interfaces from another system
using one of the standard interfaces of the workshop.
Ideally the systems implement the standard interfaces.
If not, an open source "lycan" or "shifter" (*1)
may be used to convert back and forth
between the vendor interface and the standard interface.
For the purpose of demonstrating use cases,
the "hand waving lycan" can be used
when actual lycan has not yet been coded.
Hackathon activities may focus on creating a real lycan
from a hand waving lycan.
Example hand waving lycans can be seen
{Link here to blinky pace sfractal use cases designed to explain this}


Footnote *1 - Both OpenC2 and Stixshifter use  
werewolf/lycanthrope/shapeshifter terminology.
Instead of transforming between wolf and human, these shims
transform between vendor and standard interfaces.
Stix uses "shifter" and OpenC2 uses "lycan".
