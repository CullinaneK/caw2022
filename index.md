# Cybersecurity Automation Workshop

```markdown
**Under Construction**

```

The next Cybersecurity Automation Workshop
will be held 2-June-2022 at the
[AT&T Forum](https://policyforum.att.com/att-forum/)
in Washington, DC.

## Logistics

**Agenda**

Schedule is tentatively 9AM-5PM 2-June-2022;
details are still being worked.

Feedback from the last workshop recommended
fewer keynotes and spreading the
keynotes throughout the day instead of all at kickoff.
Keynotes were reduced to 4 and they will be:
- kickoff
- just before lunch
- just after lunch
- closing

See [Agenda](./Agenda.md) for more details.

**Venue**

The [AT&T Forum](https://policyforum.att.com/att-forum/)
is located at 601 New Jersey Avenue NW, Washington, DC 20001.

Thank you to AT&T for hosting the event for us.

Light refreshments will be provided - thanks again to AT&T.
Intent is to have lunch
brought in to maximize workshop time.
A sponsor has volunteered to provide lunch.
Details are still being worked.

More details on venue, refreshments, etc are [tbd](fixlink)

**Remote Access**

Intent is to allow virtual participation.
It may not apply to all sessions or all interoperation demonstrations.

More details in [tbd](fixlink).

**Eligibility**

Open to all.
Free.
Registration will be required.

Should we reach limits (if any)
on the number of physical attendees,
some sort of rules will need to be worked out,
well in advance,
on who is eligible to attend.
Rules would probably
be based on sweat equity,
distance traveled,
a quota (ie to spread attendance across the orgs involved),
with a tie-breaker to who registers first.

**Registration**
Participation will require registration.
Details forthcoming.

## Keynotes
The 4 keynote speakers have been lined up.
Eventually add them here or make a subtending page.

## Participating Organizations
Strictly speaking none
(ie workshop is a collection of individuals
getting together to understand and get stuff interoperating
for the common good).

But the individuals have already volunteered
contributions bringing together the work of the following:
- [PACE](https://github.com/opencybersecurityalliance/PACE)
- [OpenC2](openc2.org)
- TAC
- CACAO
- SBOM
- LF SPDX
- OWASP CycloneDX
- CSAF

The hope is contributions will also represent:
- CTI/STIX/TAXII
- LF Daggerboard
- OCA Ontology
- OCA stixshifter
- OCA Kestrel
- IETF MUD
- ...

To learn more how the work of these organizations
will be specifically used in this workshop,
see
[OrgMashup](./OrgMashup/README.md)

## Objective, Goals, Focus
Attendees should walk away feeling
that they have had a positive engagement
with their peers
and have more confidence
cybersecurity automation
is in a better state.

The objective is demonstrating working interoperating
systems contributing to cybersecurity automation,
particularly across different participants
and across the different standards and organizations
in this mashup of meetups.

The method to achieve the objective will be
demonstration(s) of the use cases
in a subsequent section.

There may be a certain amount of hackathon
to fill in the gaps to complete missing aspects
of the use cases.

## Sweat Equity
To learn more about what participants are bringing
to the workshop, see
[Sweat Equity](./SweatEquity/README.md)

## Technical Details for Interoperation
see
[TechDetails](./TechDetails/README.md)
for more details on decisions being made on how to get
stuff to work together.

## Demo Use Cases
In the ideal world,
the workshop would perform a live demonstrate
one complicated use case
that evolved from quiet to under attack
touching many different child use cases
involving all the orgs and all the participants.

Being the real world, and early in our
cybsersecurity automation
journey,
the workshop will involve a series of
demonstrations - some live, some tabletop -
touching various interworking scenarios.
And they probalby won't all work,
so a certain amount of hackathon will also
be taking place to add missing lycans or
fixing bugs so that interworking can occur.

More details on exactly is planned is at
[DemoUseCases](./DemoUseCases/README.md)

## Results
Eventually results will be put
[here](./Results/README.md)

## Previous Events
Results from the two previous workshops,
and other related events,

## Governance
This workshop is being organized by one passionate individual volunteer
who was unelected and will be running it on the
D-cubed model (Duncan/democratic/dictator).
